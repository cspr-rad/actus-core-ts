/**
 *  Represent a single event generated during the lifetime of a contract.  Such events
 *  represent the atomic analytical elements comprising all events that possibly
 *  occur during the lifetime of a contract.  That is, contract events mark specific
 *  times at which either a state transition, a payoff, or both is generated from a contract.
 *  
 *  Contract events are a generic representation of a specific state transition function and
 *  pay off function with an event time according to which all events in a contract are ordered
 *  (in an series) and processed sequentially.  Thereby, processing an event in fact means that 
 *  it's state transition and payoff functions are evaluated.
